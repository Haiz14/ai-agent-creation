Diidya read the first article? A prompt has three parts context (input), to-do (processing), formatting (output). This one is expansion on to-do part i.e. What can an llm do? This article only focuses on text/chat based llm; you understand, right?


**What can a text/chat based llm do?**


- Analyse something--in case of chat based llms; If we look at things, right infront of us? We can see they are of differnet colors, sizes. If we feel it? There's different textures? Look at it atomically, there's different density of molecules, we call them solids, liquids and gases. All theses are the basis on which we differentitate sstuff. Tell an ai the basis, it will tell you what it is made of. Pass, an article, ask it to analyse it on the basis of length of different paragraphs, maybe which topics were introduced? Maybe, what aspects of those topics were introduced. In essence it's summary.


- Solve a problem--step by step; how do you solve a parenthised mathematical expression `9 * (5 + 2)`; first the bracket, then the multiplication; step by step. The above can be termed as doing some semantic operations. Where each letter means something and there are rules for doing it. Now abstract this semantic operation in real life terms, `I went to the market and bought 5 eggs and 2 dragon fruit. Both costing $9, how much did i spend, did i over indulgr?` you get the answer by creating a semantic expression in the language of maths. And voila! llm has solved a problem. In eseence solving a problem is analysing what it's constituent particles are and creating an exrpession of it then rearranging things; tranforming them according to certain rules i.e. a process and maybe remembering some optimisations. Yooohoooooooooooooooooooo.


- Personification--change the tone of the text, give it a personality; add a bit of bias, make it a karen; say something sarcastic; focus only on the negatives and blamin, make it cheerful and bubbly like a child; reduce the vocabulary; make it exciting, adventorous. Create relations, experiences it had, what it felt, what it's goals are, what it's reputations is around the world? what it's personality, worldview is, things it can see but never acknowledge always changing the narrative and be blind towards it.


Now a few prompting examples, ain't gonnna be a prompting lesson without some prompting right? douchebags :)


All the prompts are tried on 2025 march, freely available gpt. Certain ai's are more dumb and would need more context, certain are too powerful and need no context. All llm's are different do what suits you.


# Analysing

Now, to begin with, it's a hell of a drug. Analysisng requires a basis; basis is caracteristic upon wich we say these are two or three... seperate entites. Tell AI the basis, it will do a good job. Look?

```
human: the quick brown fox runs over the lazy dog, tell me how many foxes there are, how many dogs there are, how many animals there are, how many personality traits there are

ai:
There is 1 fox.
There is 1 dog.
There are 2 animals (1 fox + 1 dog).
There are 4 personality traits mentioned: quick, brown, lazy, and possibly clever (implied for the fox).
```

Whelp. the ai doen't seem to understand what personlaity traits are? Another ai considered dog as the personification of `loyalty`. Seem's like there's lot's of there's contention on what's personality traits. And it's hard to get a correct analysis on that. When the basis i unclear, results are bad. Of course asking the same question on a smaller model deepseek-r1 1.5b parameter models also gives bad result. Dunno about 0.5 b model.


Let's try another one,  This one is even more abstract basis.
```
human: "God said, let there be light" why would God say that, analyze it on the basis of benefits God will get? And then whatever you analyzed, analyze it again on the basis of is it really beneficial to God?  
ai:  

### **Step 1: Initial Analysis ‚Äì Benefits God Might Get**  

1. **Establishment of Order:**  
   - Light brings **order out of chaos**, separating day from night.  
   ‚úÖ **Benefit:** A structured, balanced universe capable of sustaining life and beauty.  

2. **Foundation for Creation:**  
   - Light is necessary for ecosystems and life to exist.  
   ‚úÖ **Benefit:** A foundation that allows for future creation, adding meaning and complexity.  

3. **Manifestation of Power and Glory:**  
   - Creating light with a mere command demonstrates **supreme authority**.  
   ‚úÖ **Benefit:** Establishing God‚Äôs omnipotence and reinforcing divine supremacy.  

4. **Enabling Perception and Knowledge:**  
   - Light allows for awareness, perception, and appreciation of creation.  
   ‚úÖ **Benefit:** Beings can recognize and appreciate the Creator‚Äôs work, fostering reverence.  

5. **Facilitation of Goodness and Morality:**  
   - Light is symbolic of **goodness, purity, and truth**, contrasting darkness.  
   ‚úÖ **Benefit:** Establishing a moral framework where light (good) triumphs over darkness (evil).  

---

### **Step 2: Secondary Analysis ‚Äì Is It Really Beneficial to God?**  

1. **Does God Need Order?**  
   - God, being **omnipotent and omniscient**, operates beyond order or chaos. Order benefits creation, not necessarily God.  
   ‚ùóÔ∏è**Verdict:** Not inherently beneficial to God but essential for a functioning universe.  

2. **Does Creation Add Value to God?**  
   - Since God is **self-sufficient and eternal**, creation doesn‚Äôt add intrinsic value to God. Creation serves as an expression of divine will, not a necessity.  
   ‚ùóÔ∏è**Verdict:** Not beneficial in terms of need but perhaps as an act of divine love or expression.  

3. **Does Demonstrating Power Benefit God?**  
   - God‚Äôs power is **absolute** and does not need validation. Displaying power benefits created beings by inspiring awe and obedience, not God.  
   ‚ùóÔ∏è**Verdict:** Beneficial for creation, not for God‚Äôs self-interest.  

4. **Does Receiving Worship or Recognition Benefit God?**  
   - Worship and reverence fulfill **human spiritual needs** more than they benefit God. God does not require praise for sustenance or validation.  
   ‚ùóÔ∏è**Verdict:** Not a necessity for God but serves as a means for creation to align with divine will.  

5. **Does a Moral Framework Serve God‚Äôs Purpose?**  
   - A moral universe provides guidance for creation, ensuring harmony and goodness. God, being beyond morality, is not subject to this framework.  
   ‚ùóÔ∏è**Verdict:** Beneficial to sentient beings, not inherently to God.  

---

### üéØ **Final Conclusion:**  
From a purely **self-benefit perspective**, **"Let there be light"** does not offer any **direct gain** to God. The act seems to be an expression of divine will and purpose, intended more for the benefit of creation rather than fulfilling any need or desire of God. Creation, order, and morality serve **the created, not the Creator**. üåü

```

Seems like, gpt was trained, well. Certainly did the analysis good enough, or well if i might say. Wondered, what a powerful llm would say? probably something similar.


Finally, something really sane, provided with lot's f context:
```
human: below is an article, tell me the topics discused and the way those topics were explored.

Ethnographic and cross-cultural studies of emotions have shown the variety of ways in which emotions differ with cultures. Because of these differences, many cross-cultural psychologists and anthropologists challenge the idea of universal classifications of emotions altogether. Cultural differences have been observed in the way in which emotions are valued, expressed, and regulated. The social norms for emotions, such as the frequency with or circumstances in which they are expressed, also vary drastically.[26][27] For example, the demonstration of anger is encouraged by Kaluli people, but condemned by Utku Inuit.[28]

The largest piece of evidence that disputes the universality of emotions is language. Differences within languages directly correlate to differences in emotion taxonomy. Languages differ in that they categorize emotions based on different components. Some may categorize by event types, whereas others categorize by action readiness. Furthermore, emotion taxonomies vary due to the differing implications emotions have in different languages.[26] That being said, not all English words have equivalents in all other languages and vice versa, indicating that there are words for emotions present in some languages but not in others.[29] Emotions such as the schadenfreude in German and saudade in Portuguese are commonly expressed in emotions in their respective languages, but lack an English equivalent.

Some languages do not differentiate between emotions that are considered to be the basic emotions in English. For instance, certain African languages have one word for both anger and sadness, and others for shame and fear. There is ethnographic evidence that even challenges the universality of the category "emotions" because certain cultures lack a specific word relating to the English word "emotions".

And there ya go, examples of simple analysis.

# Solving

# Personification

# putting-it-all-together

Think of analysis as taking things out from something big, problem solving as creating someting big from small and personificaltion as making slight changes without any change in essence i.e. changing the cover of sofa.
