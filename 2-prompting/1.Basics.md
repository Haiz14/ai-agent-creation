Tis is written like a technical docs, i am lazy and ain't gonna sugarcoat it up.

Ai chat like GPT can do loads of stuff, but for a robust application; you should verify certain outputs; you should reject certain prompts; You should know how to write prompts. Let's learn righ now.

SUppose you are gonna read a big article, but english is not your first language, you dont' know many words. Maybe you can ask ai to add definition of hard words just beside them paras. Like `That guy's antics flabbergasted me. He is FUCKING INSANE.` Ai can add definiton of the word `flabbergasted`right beside it. (MAybe you could ask ai to add citations too?)

How would you write the prompt, what instruction and information you need to give it?

1. context (input): information you want ai to have (In this case; the article you want to read. Another interesting use case, you a learning a new laguage and you know a few words. Ask the ai to add definitions and sound of all words you don't know. Good stuff. )

2.  to-do (processing): what should the ai do with the information you gave? tell it. (in this case, tell it to add definitions of word that a non-native english speaker will find hard. maybe you can even ask ai to add exaples of those words? maybe return the article in markdown footnote) 


3. Formatting (output): how should the ai respond back? Which file format? (Maybe you want ai to respond back in markdown? With the definitons as footnots?)


The final prompt (it failed) ran it on gemini flash 2.0 March 2025

Below is an article that a non native speaker will read. Add definitions of hard words as footnotes in a markdown file.

When World War I ended in 1918, the last thing people wanted was an even greater conflict. So why did the world return to combat just two decades later to fight World War II?

Granted, Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939 triggered declarations of war from France and the United Kingdom, formally starting World War II. But that event was only the final straw in a series of events. Various other economic and political challenges had been building up tension for years.

the response was a README file that had foot notes but **footnotes were not linked with words**.

[^1]: **Granted:** Admitted to be true; acknowledged.
[^2]: **Triggered:** Caused (an event or situation) to happen or exist.
[^3]: **Declarations:** Formal or explicit statements or announcements.
[^4]: **Formally:** In accordance with the rules of convention or etiquette; officially.
[^5]: **Final straw:** The last in a series of unpleasant events that makes someone unable to accept or deal with a situation.
[^6]: **Tension:** Mental or emotional strain.

Tried again, but this time ai was first asked to do the process part and then create the out. Absolute perfection.

```text
Below is an article that a non native speaker will read. Add definitions of hard words just beside those words in parenthesis

After this create a markdown file, and add those words as foot notes

Absolutely! Here's the article with definitions beside the words:

When World War I ended in 1918, the last thing people wanted was an even greater conflict. So why did the world return to combat (fighting or warfare) just two decades later to fight World War II?

Granted (admitted to be true; acknowledged), Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939 triggered (caused (an event or situation) to happen or exist) declarations (formal or explicit statements or announcements) of war from France and the United Kingdom, formally (in accordance with the rules of convention or etiquette; officially) starting World War II. But that event was only the final straw (the last in a series of unpleasant events that makes someone unable to accept or deal with a situation) in a series of events. Various other economic and political challenges had been building up tension (mental or emotional strain) for years.

Now, here's the markdown file with the words as footnotes:
```

Seems like if you are using a less powerful model; or even a good model. Try asking ai to do things step by step. It's a better practice, unless of course tokens are costly and you gotta optimize query up. (Though, if tokens are costly  the ai model should be able to do it in prompt1. Tried prompt1 in gemini-thinking, gpt basic, clause 3.7 they all got it right. Probably only weaker models need step by step instructions.) 


So finally, three parts of a prompt,
